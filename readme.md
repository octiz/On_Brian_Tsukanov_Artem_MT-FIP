Amstel Aiding Ale - Midterm/Final Project Assembly



INSPIRATION/STORY:
Amstel Aiding Ale is the brand mash-up between Amstel Beer and the Ban-daid Brand.
It is a collaboration between Brian On and Artem Tsukanov.
The two have come together to create a unique new brand called Amstel Aiding Ale.
Artem has taken the approach to do the graphical portion of the assignment while Brian has taken on the web development portion.
Our new beer brand is a take on craft beer that can replenish in a similar way to how ban-daids can quickly fix a small cut and/or injury.
Our main focus for this new brand was to focus on the origin of Amstel beer which is the Netherlands!
Our team has utilized the colors of the Netherlands flag to ensure those who drink our beer know where it's from.

DESIGN:
The logo ideas were an immediate cohesion between the two creators.
Our logo and label contains what we wanted to accomplish; ensuring consumers recognize it as a collaboration with the ban-daid brand and the origin of the craft.
We have come up with a ban-daid label to wrap around our bottle while creating a modern and sharp logo that stands out. Additionally, we wanted the logo design to be sharp, simple and unique. Although, we have already established some issues as we believe our logo is not simplistic enough at this current stage.

WHAT WE OFFER (CURRENTLY):
Currently, our whole brand is under construction. From logo development, to website development, we believe that this is the stepping stone to reaching where we want our brand to be.
